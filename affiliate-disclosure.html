    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
    <p>
      BracketologyBuilder participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn commissions
      when users click through links to third-party platforms and create accounts or complete qualifying actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These commissions help support the development and operation of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not control or operate any third-party betting or gaming services.
